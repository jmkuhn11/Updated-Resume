# Updated Resume

## Development

I already have a portfolio with some of my work in it using basic html and css. It holds my credentials, and will let future employers know of some of my capabilities. However, not only was it in need of an update, but I also wanted to show off some of the new skills I have learned since then. React is a new form of coding that not everyone in the field uses today. Showing employers that I also have this skill will help my chances for consideration. Through creating this page, I gained a much better understanding of how to use React and how to file structure pages in React and MERN. I also learned a new way to deploy more advanced applications publicly through github.

## Installation

The new dependencies one will need is react, react-dom, react-scripts, and gh-pages, along with the scripts predeploy and deploy. You'll also have to create the react app in the terminal first to make sure these dependencies and file structure are set up correctly.

## Usage

One will click on the link and be taken to my updated portfolio and resume. The main page is an about me section, listing some of my accomplishments and backstory in the professional field. Clicking on the portfolio folder tab one to some of the varios projects I have worked along, along with their github repositories. Clicking on the contact field allows possible eomployers to reach out to me if they would like to discuss professional matters further. And if these employers need more information, they are able to click on my resume tab, which lists some of the skills I have learned, along with the possibility to download my resume.
